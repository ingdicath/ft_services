# **ft_services**
CODAM project Curriculum 2019

- **Project type**: System Administration and Networking.
- **Objective**: Setting up an infrastructure of different services using **Kubernetes**.

----
## Requirements

 This proyect is aimed to set up a multi-service cluster. It must meet the following requirements:

- Each service will have to _run in a dedicated container_.
- Each container must bear the same name as the service concerned.
- For performance reasons, containers have to be build using **Alpine Linux**.
- Containers will need to have a Dockerfile which is called in the setup.sh
- Build by yourself the images that the project will use.

Mandatory set ups:
- The _Kubernetes web dashboard_.
- The **Load Balancer(MetalLB)**.  It will be the only entry point to your cluster. Load Balancer will have a single ip.
- A **WordPress** website listening on port 5050.
- **phpMyAdmin**, listening on port 5000 and linked with the **MySQL database (MariaDB)**.
- A container with an **nginx** server listening on ports 80 and 443.
- A **FTPS** server listening on port 21.
- A **Grafana** platform, listening on port 3000, linked with an _InfluxDB database_.

#### Restriccions

- It is forbidden to take already build images or use services like DockerHub.
- Usage of Node Port services, Ingress Controller object or kubectl port-forward command is prohibited.

```

### kubectl

:warning: Before start using this commands, be sure minikube is running.
```
# Display all (namespaces, pods, etc)
kubectl get all
# List the current namespaces in a cluster
kubectl get namespaces
# List current pods:
kubectl get pods
# List all pods in ps output format with more information (such as node name):
kubectl get pods -o wide
# List the current deployments:
kubectl get deployments
# List the current services:
kubectl get services
# List ingress:
kubectl get ingress
# Display events with changes
kubectl get events -w
# Allow to change between namespaces. Without the name, it will list all namespaces available.
kubens <"namespace's name">
# Displays IPs
kubectl get pod -o wide
```

#### Create Namespace / POD / Deployment / Service / Ingress

```
# Using command line (for namespace)
kubectl create namespace <"namespace's name">
#Using YALM or JSON file
kubectl apply -f <"file name">
```
- From Dashboard on webpage (Except Ingress)

:warning: For Ingress, it's important to allow an addon
```
minikube addons enable ingress
```

#### Delete Namespace / Pod / Deployment / Service
```
# Using command line (namespace/ pod)
kubectl delete namespace <"namespace's name">
# Using YALM or JSON file and command line
kubectl delete -f <"file name">
```
- From Dashboard on webpage


#### PODs/ Deployment details

```
# List the current pods in a cluster
kubectl get pods
# List the current deployment
kubectl get deployments
# List the deployment apps
kubectl get deployments.apps
# Display details about a pod/ service
kubectl describe pod <"pod name">
kubectl describe service <"service name">
# Display pod's logs:
kubectl logs -f <"file name">
```

#### Access to PODs
```
# Using command line
kubectl exec -it <"pod's name"> -- /bin/bash
# Check which the Operating System is (inside the pod) 
cat /etc/*release
# List the available hosts(inside the pod)
cat /etc/hosts
# Display conexion between two pods (inside the pod; before you had to create a service)
ping mariadb-service
#Kubernetes has a intern DNS, for that reason is able to resolve conexion between pods.
```

#### Create a Service
```
#Using YALM or JSON file
kubectl apply -f <"file name">
```

### Run on Windows

Using the docker motor inside the minikube

1. Run in the terminal:
```
minikube docker-env
```
2. Check what do you need to run
```
# To point your shell to minikube's docker-daemon, run:
# & minikube -p minikube docker-env | Invoke-Expression
```
3. Then, run:
```
docker ps
```

#### Mount a volume, set working directory, execute command
```
 docker run -it --rm --name my-maven-project -v /c/Users/diani/kuber_practice/Bloque11Aplicacion/aplicacion:/usr/src/mymaven -w /usr/src/mymaven maven:3.3-jdk-8 mvn clean install
```

## Concepts

### Namespaces
Kubernetes supports multiple virtual clusters backed by the same physical cluster. 
These virtual clusters are called namespaces.

##### When to Use Multiple Namespaces 
Namespaces are intended for use in environments with many users spread across multiple teams, or projects. 
For clusters with a few to tens of users, you should not need to create or think about namespaces at all.


### Pod

- Pods are the smallest deployable units of computing that you can create and manage in Kubernetes.
- Pod is like a container.
- Pod is the minimun unit of work.
- A Pod is a group of one or more containers, with shared storage and network resources, and a specification for how to run the containers.

### Deployment

A Deployment provides declarative updates for Pods and ReplicaSets.


### Services

- Kubernetes Pods are created and destroyed to match the state of your cluster. Pods are nonpermanent resources.
- **ReplicaSets** create and destroy **Pods** dynamically 

A Service is an abstraction which defines a logical set of Pods and a policy by which to access them (sometimes this pattern is called a micro-service). The set of Pods targeted by a Service is usually determined by a selector.
Es el punto de entrada, siempre es fijo.

### Ingress

Ingress exposes HTTP and HTTPS routes from outside the cluster to services within the cluster. Traffic routing is controlled by rules defined on the Ingress resource.

							    |
							[Ingress]
							----|----
							[Services]

### Liveness and Readiness Probes

**Readiness** probes are designed to let Kubernetes know when the app is ready to serve traffic. Kubernetes makes sure the readiness probe passes before allowing a service to send traffic to the pod. If a readiness probe starts to fail, Kubernetes stops sending traffic to the pod until it passes.

Kubernetes uses **readiness probes** to decide when the container is available for accepting traffic. The readiness probe is used to control which pods are used as the backends for a service. A pod is considered ready when all of its containers are ready. If a pod is not ready, it is removed from service load balancers. For example, if a container loads a large cache at startup and takes minutes to start, you do not want to send requests to this container until it is ready, or the requests will failâyou want to route requests to other pods, which are capable of servicing requests.
_Una vez levantado el servicio, si esta en disposicion de aceptar o no peticiones._

Kubernetes uses **liveness probes** to know when to restart a container. If a container is unresponsiveâperhaps the application is deadlocked due to a multi-threading defectârestarting the container can make the application more available, despite the defect. It certainly beats paging someone in the middle of the night to restart a container.

Masters
Nodes
Pods
Services
Deployments

Kubernetes is an orchestrator for microservice apps

- **Masters**: there are in charge
- **Nodes**: are minions, they are doing the work
We've got the code, and we containerize it. And, we define it in an object call a deployment, then we write it up and define in a YAML file.

Then we give the file to K8s on the master, and the master looks at the file and deploys the app on the cluster. 

### MASTERS
- :warning: Don't run user workloads on Master
- API server:  It's our frontâend into the master or the control plane.
	Kubernetes API server: main part of Master.


### NODES

#### Kubelet -> Main Kubernetes agent
- The kubelet is the primary "node agent" that runs on each node.
- Registers node with cluster
- Watches apiserver
- Instantiates pods
- Reports back to master
- Exposes endpoint on :10255

If a pod fails on a node, the kubelet is not resposible for restarting it or finding another node  for it to run. It simply reports the state back to the master. 


#### Container Engine -> Docker or rocket
##### Does container management:
- pulling images
- starting/stopping containers

##### Pluggable
- Usually Docker
- Can be CoreOS rkt (rocket)


#### kube-proxy -> Kubernetes working
Is like the network brains of the node

##### Kubernetes networking
- Pod IP addresses
	- All containers in a pod share a single IP


### Declarative model & Desired State

Kubernetes operates in a declarative model. This means we give the API server manifest files that describe how we want the cluster to look and feel. YAML or JSON

### PODS

- Kubernetes run containers always inside of pods.
- A container without a pod in Kubernetes is a naked container.
- Pods can have multiple containers (advanced use-case)
- Pod is a ring-fenced (cercado) environment to run containers. Itself doesn't run anything. It can have 1) Network stack, 2) Kernel namespaces, etc,  n containers.
- All containerss in pod share the pod environment


## TIPS

### Fix error: nginx: [emerg] open() "/run/nginx/nginx.pid" failed (2: No such file or directory), running:
RUN mkdir -p /run/nginx

### To check to see what was running on port
```
netstat -tulpn
```

# Example config file /etc/vsftpd.conf
#
# The default compiled in settings are fairly paranoid. This sample file
# loosens things up a bit, to make the ftp daemon more usable.
# Please see vsftpd.conf.5 for all compiled in defaults.
#
# READ THIS: This example file is NOT an exhaustive list of vsftpd options.
# Please read the vsftpd.conf.5 manual page to get a full idea of vsftpd's
# capabilities.
#
# Allow anonymous FTP? (Beware - allowed by default if you comment this out).
anonymous_enable=NO
#
# Uncomment this to allow local users to log in.
local_enable=YES
#
# Uncomment this to enable any form of FTP write command.
write_enable=YES
#
# Default umask for local users is 077. You may wish to change this to 022,
# if your users expect that (022 is used by most other ftpd's). Number is in octal
local_umask=022
#
# Activate directory messages - messages given to remote users when they
# go into a certain directory.
dirmessage_enable=YES
#
# Activate logging of uploads/downloads.
xferlog_enable=YES
#
# You may override where the log file goes if you like. The default is shown
# below.
xferlog_file=/var/log/vsftpd.log
# The target log file can be vsftpd_log_file or xferlog_file.
# This depends on setting xferlog_std_format parameter
# Activate logging of uploads/downloads.
xferlog_enable=YES
#
# Make sure PORT transfer connections originate from port 20 (ftp-data).
connect_from_port_20=YES
#
# You may fully customise the login banner string:
ftpd_banner=Welcome to the jungle FTP service.
#
#
# You may specify an explicit list of local users to chroot() to their home
# directory. If chroot_local_user is YES, then this list becomes a list of
# users to NOT chroot().
# (Warning! chroot'ing can be very dangerous. If using chroot, make sure that
# the user does not have write access to the top level directory within the
# chroot)
chroot_local_user=YES
#chroot_list_enable=YES
# (default follows)
#chroot_list_file=/etc/vsftpd.chroot_list
#
# When "listen" directive is enabled, vsftpd runs in standalone mode and
# listens on IPv4 sockets. This directive cannot be used in conjunction
# with the listen_ipv6 directive.
listen=YES
#
# This directive enables listening on IPv6 sockets. To listen on IPv4 and IPv6
# sockets, you must run two copies of vsftpd with two configuration files.
# Make sure, that one of the listen options is commented !!
#listen_ipv6=YES

#pam_service_name=vsftpd
#tcp_wrappers=YES
# If your version doesn't work with tcp_wrappers, add seccomp_sandbox=NO to the config.

seccomp_sandbox=NO
#
# We need to specify the location of our certificate
# and key files. We actually combined both pieces of
# information into a single file, so we will point
# both options to the same file:
rsa_cert_file=/etc/ssl/certs/vsftpd.crt
rsa_private_key_file=/etc/ssl/private/vsftpd.key
#
# Next, we need enable the use of these files and
# disable anonymous users. We should also force the
# use of SSL for both data transfer and login
# routines. This will make the security mandatory:
#
ssl_enable=YES
force_local_data_ssl=YES
force_local_logins_ssl=YES
#
# Next, we will restrict the type of connection to
# TLS, which is more secure than SSL. We will do this
# by explicitly allowing TLS and denying the use of SSL:
ssl_tlsv1=YES
ssl_sslv2=NO
ssl_sslv3=NO
#
# We'll add a few more configuration options before finishing:
require_ssl_reuse=YES
ssl_ciphers=HIGH
#
# external ip here
# if you are in a private network and expect to be visited by the outside
pasv_address=192.168.99.36
# this is for localhost
# pasv_address=192.168.99.100
